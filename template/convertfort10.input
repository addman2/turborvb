&OPTION
!bigram=.true.  ! Uses ram to store initial file.
!symiesup=.true. ! Uses symmetries for contracted orbitals in AGP.
!eqion=.true. ! When .false. you can allow for a permutation of ions but also the pseudo corresponding to fort.10_out has to be defined (if pseudo are used) with the name            pseudo_out
/

&CONTROL
!change_jas=.true. !if false do not compute the output Jastrow (read in fort.10_out)
!change_contr=.true. !Do not compute contracted coefficient Det (read in fort.10_out)
!force_real=.false. ! if true contracted output orbitals are real.
!real_agp=.true.    ! It uses the numerical algorithm to obtain a real agp with the maximum overlap
!rmax=xxxx          ! It uses the numerical algorithm to obtain an agp with cutoff radius of rmax (bohr) and 
		    ! with the maximum overlap
!max_iter=xxxx 	    ! It is the maximum number of iteration for the numerical algorithm (suggested not much more than 10000) 
!prec=xxxxxx	    ! It is the precision required for the numerical version of the algorithm.                  
! epsdgel=1d-15 ! default  
!yespardiag=.true.  ! To use the parallelized matrix matrix moltiplication
/
&mesh_info
! This is the IMPORTANT section you have always to define
!  (the default is OK for the rest) use DFT mesh as an hint.  
!nx=100         ! not necessary with optbin=.true. (the mesh is given).
!ax=0.1
!nbufd=10000    ! Reduce size of nbufd for reducing the RAM memory used.

kl=-7        ! kl=-6 Use conjugate gradients to solve Sx=f (convenient for nweight > # parameters, otherwise use kl=-7) x= direction in par space, f= energy deriv.
epsdgel=1d-5 ! threshold for the elimination of parameters from minimization.
!tolcg=1d-8  ! Accuracy in solving S x =f in SR step in parallel mode by                       conjugate gradients.
ncg=1       ! number of SR directions x used to compute the Hessian to accelerate convergence to the minimum (use ncg small!, ncg=1 simple SR).
!membig=.true. ! for small allocation and i/o output use membig=.false. when possible.
nweight=10000 ! bin length for each QMC optimization step: the bin.
!nmore_force=1 ! if using dynamics the corresponding nweight is multiplied by nmore_force only when computing                  ionic forces (ieskin>0). iboot=0 in this case (otherwise forced).
nbinr=10000     ! number of sample/walker for each bin used to evaluate error bars                     (nweight-iboot)/nbinr should be preferably integer
iboot=0    ! disregarded initial number of configurations in the averages                    over the bin nweight.
tpar=0.35   ! the step predicted by a given optimization technique is reduced                 by a factor tpar to improve stability (QMC has noise!)
parr=0.1d0  ! the small eigenvalues of the matrix S are regularized                           (parr=0 no regularization, small values help to go faster but                    less stable convergence).

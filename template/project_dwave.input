The first  molecular rewritten in fort.10_new (output).                         The second is the number of orbitals that we want to skip                       in writing (i.e. I do not want to replace the first s,d,                        E1 molecular orbitals and replace only the last two).                           The third number (the last) is the number of molecular                          orbital to be replaced in fort.10_new.
